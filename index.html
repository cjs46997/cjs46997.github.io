<h3>Why the Red Sox are my favorite team:</h3>
 <p>Growing up as a kid I always loved watching baseball and especially loved the Red Sox. I think my love for the Red Sox was mainly because they were good and partially because my favorite player was on their team playing my favorite position.
 Jacoby Ellsbury, the speedy centerfielder, was my favorite baseball player. Since then, he has joined the dark side... the Yankees.  </p>
<h3>History:</h3>
<p>The Organization started in 1903 when the Minor Western League declared its equality with the National League. This league is known as the American League. </p>

<p> Boston was a dominant team in the early years winning five championships by 1918. After 1918, however, the team wen to on a 86 year championship drought. This drought has been attributed to the "Curse of the Bambino". This curse stemmed from the trade of the great player Babe Ruth.
